# NodeHue

A very simple controller app for the Philips Hue lighting system. Can currently scan the local network for a bridge, 
read all light info and provide a simple interface for turning specific lights off and on.

## TODO

- correctly displaying the current light color
- modal popup for changing hue/saturation/brightness
- make it look fancier
